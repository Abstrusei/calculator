# calculator

This is a calculator for the browser built using Javascript, HTML and CSS. This project is a part of The Odin Project 'Foundations' course and was completed to help strengthen my Javascript abilities - DOM Manipulation in particular.  To use the calculator, simply click or press the buttons as you typically would. You can also enter numbers using the keyboard, for added ease. Additionally, you will be able to clear the calculator uisng the red 'AC' button. 

With the applicaiton being made specifically for the browser, it is not responsive (as in, it may appear strangely on mobile).
